# Coherence Theory (HMR)

Coherence Theory shows that intelligence, nature, and civilization all follow the same deep pattern. In this repository, consciousness, math, physics, biology, AI, and spirituality are woven into a single idea:

Reality is a recursively self-similar coherence field populated by localized intelligences whose long-run evolution increases global coherence.

The Holistic Model of Reality (HMR) is expressed in three exactly parallel axiom sets with 1:1:1 structural parity:

- HMR-Sci (science-first), a purely scientific, non-agentic coherence model; appears to satisfy major requirements for a proper ToE.
  - Fields, symmetries, action/Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, tensor equations, quantum structure, and recovery of GR + SM (with new testable consequences) are available.
- HMR-Int (intelligence-first), the same idea/structure read as a universal intelligence (a system of systems); author's unscientific opinion.  
- HMR-Hin (Hinduism), the same idea/structure mapped onto Advaita/Samkhya language (Brahman, Atman, Maya, Rta, the gunas, Lila); author failed to identify a difference between their opinion and Hinduism.

These are not competing theories — they are three internally consistent perspectives of the same underlying skeleton. If the HMR-Sci axiom set is empirically sound, the validity of the HMR-Int and HMR-Hin sets follows automatically from their 1:1:1 mapping.

- No internal contradictions across the three sets  
- Scope: mind + math + physics + biology + AI + meaning  
- Depth: explicit axioms, theorem grid, and cross-domain consequences

If you do not want to read everything yourself, you can load these papers into your favorite AI model and ask it to evaluate it for iternal consistency and practical application.
